nabucco-selenium-extension
==========================

This product is a Selenium IDE plugin and offers the functionality to export Selenium-testcases to Nabucco TA from PRODYNA AG.

The code from StoredVars-Plugin served as an example and thus as origin for our plugin. Credits for StoredVars-Plugin go to 'http://blog.reallysimplethoughts.com/'.
